Ah, I see! You're looking for a fish that's suitable for cooking in a barbecue clip (or a fish grilling basket) in the oven. This method is great for keeping the fish intact and easy to flip. Here are some good fish choices for this cooking method:


*  Whole Snapper: Snapper is still a great choice for this method. Its skin helps keep the fish together while the flesh cooks evenly.

*  Mackerel: This fish has a rich, oily flesh that stays moist and flavorful when cooked in a barbecue clip. Its skin crisps up nicely too.

*  Trout: Trout, especially Rainbow or Brown Trout, is ideal for this cooking style. It has a delicate flavor and the skin holds the flesh together well.

*  Barramundi: Again, barramundi is a good option. Its firm flesh can withstand the pressure of the barbecue clip without falling apart.

*  Sea Bass: If available, sea bass is another excellent choice. It has a mild, buttery flavor, and the flesh holds up well when cooked in a clip.


# Snapper

Preparing a whole snapper for roasting in a barbecue clip involves several steps to ensure it's flavorful and has a reduced "fishy" smell. Here's a guide on how to prepare it:
Cleaning and Preparing the Snapper

    Descale and Gut the Fish: If not already done, remove the scales by scraping a knife against the grain of the scales from tail to head. Gut the fish by making a shallow incision along the belly and removing the innards. Rinse the fish inside and out under cold running water.

    Removing Strong Fishy Smell:
        Milk Bath: Soaking the fish in milk for about 20 minutes can help reduce the fishy odor. The casein in milk binds to the trimethylamine (which causes the fishy smell) and removes it.
        Citrus Rinse: Rinse the fish with lemon or lime juice. Citrus can neutralize fishy odors and add a fresh scent and flavor.

    Pat Dry: Pat the fish dry with paper towels. It's important for the fish to be dry to get a good sear and prevent sticking.

    Seasoning:
        Inside and Out: Season both the inside and outside of the fish. You can use salt, pepper, and other herbs and spices of your choice.
        Aromatic Stuffing: Stuff the cavity of the fish with aromatics like sliced lemon, herbs (dill, parsley, cilantro), garlic, and slices of ginger. This not only adds flavor but also helps in reducing any fishy smell.

Deboning (Optional)

Deboning a whole fish is quite challenging and not typically done before roasting, as the bones contribute to the flavor and moisture of the cooked fish. However, you can ask your fishmonger to fillet the fish for you, keeping the fillets attached to the head and tail. This method is called "butterflying" and can make the fish easier to eat once cooked.
Cooking in a Barbecue Clip

    Oil the Clip: Lightly oil the barbecue clip to prevent sticking.

    Insert the Fish: Place the seasoned and stuffed snapper into the barbecue clip.

    Roasting: Roast in a preheated oven at around 350°F (180°C). The cooking time will depend on the size of the fish, but it usually takes about 15-20 minutes. The fish is done when its flesh is opaque and flakes easily with a fork.

    Rest Before Serving: Let the fish rest for a few minutes after taking it out of the oven. This allows the juices to redistribute, making the fish more moist and flavorful.

Serving

Serve the snapper with additional lemon wedges, a drizzle of olive oil, and perhaps a side of roasted vegetables or a fresh salad. Enjoy your perfectly roasted snapper!
